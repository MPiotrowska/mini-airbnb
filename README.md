# WindBnb (Airbnb Simple Version)

This project is a simplified version of Airbnb. I started working on this as part of the [Dev challenges project ideas](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD), but eventually decided to add a bit of the original Airbnb homepage design, that includes a full-width hero section (screenshot below).

## Live Link

The site is hosted on Netlify and you can visit it [here](https://mini-airbnb.netlify.app/).

## Designs

##### Airbnb Homepage | (Design 1)

## Tech

This project uses the following tech:

  - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
  - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## State Management

Since components of the app needed to share state, I decided to experiment with React's [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).


## Setup

Once you've cloned the repo, head on over to your terminal and run the following commands.

### `yarn install`

- Installs all dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
