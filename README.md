# WindBnb

This project is a simplified version of Airbnb. During the project's first iteration, I partly followed the Figma designs that were provided by the [Dev challenges project ideas page](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD).

After deployment, I decided to reiterate and added a full-width hero section as seen in Airbnb's homepage (screenshot below).

## ðŸ“° User Stories

  - I can see a list of properties
  - I can see property card with a name, rating, apartment type, and super host
  - I can open filter drawer
  - I can filter properties by location and number of guests
  - I can see pages following given designs

## Live Link

The site is hosted on Netlify and you can visit it [here](https://mini-airbnb.netlify.app/).


## Project Management

To track the progress of all subsequent iterations, I decided to use [Github's own Kanban style board](https://github.com/MPiotrowska/mini-airbnb/projects/1) and automate the process using pull requests.
